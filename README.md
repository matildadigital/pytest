# pytest

The included Python script transforms sample data from daily.csv and companies.csv into one merged CSV file. Two example dates are given to limit the merged data. 

Desired Improvements
- Frequency selection: A parameter for changing the frequency of the data returned from the data frame.
- Class functionality: This will improve reusability so it can be added as a module for other projects.
- Automated tests: Automated tests for developers to easily check if the code is behaving properly.
- Django server: Create a Django server with a simple UI for uploading the CSVs and selecting dates and frequency periods that routes to a download of the merged CSV data.

Reflection
This was a great opportunity to solve an interesting data problem with pandas, numpy, and Django. This was my first time working with these libraries and the Django framework. My next step is to continue developing this project and deploy it for my friends and professional peers to test out so I can receive their feedback to revise it for a second version. This was a wonderful learning opportunity, and I'm excited to create a data visualization project for myself after being inspired by a Python data science talk I attended with Women Who Code this week. This code challenge has given me a great jumpstart toward that goal.

Best,
Matilda
